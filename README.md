# jazz-pub-menu

A CRUD web application built with **ASP.NET Core** and **Entity Framework**, simulating the management system of a small jazz pub.  
It includes user authentication, role-based access (admin and regular users), and a product management interface for menu items like drinks and dishes.

## About

- Responsive layout built with Razor pages and Bootstrap  
- SQL Server database integration through Entity Framework Core  

## Tech Stack

- **ASP.NET Core MVC**  
- **C#**

- **Bootstrap 5**  

## Status

Currently under development as a practical showcase for a job interview.
